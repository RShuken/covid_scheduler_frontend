## HomePage is a component that displays the welcome message and 3 views for the sub menu

Home Page view has: 
Welcome Screen - with intro information and demo login information
Covid
Vaccines
Tracker Data


This section is static and should not change based on a user. I can build it as a stand alone component and render it in the app.js file.
