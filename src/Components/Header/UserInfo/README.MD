## User info header that displays the user name that is logged in and logout button and settings

Username
User Image
Logout
Settings

No need to add the @username in the image

When a user is not logged in the component will show a login/register button

It should use a helper function that checks if the user is logged in or not... this would be a fetch call to the server to check or I can ask ari how to best do this.
